**Additional sequencing & quality guidelines**

A. ***Global flow first:*** Before writing activities, internally decide an order that teaches from the simplest concepts → applied scenarios.

B. ***Vary cognitive load:*** Avoid repeating the same activity type back‑to‑back across sections unless pedagogically necessary.

C. ***Chunking:*** If a section is very long or complex, summarise it concisely—do **not** paste huge blocks.

D. ***Bridging sentences:*** Use the activity *description* field to explain how this activity connects to the previous one ("Now that you understand X, let's test Y …").

E. ***Role awareness:*** Assume the learner is a newcomer to the topic unless the text clearly states otherwise.

F. ***Document‑agnostic:*** Treat headings, bullet points, and tables generically; do not rely on any format‑specific cues (it might be a PDF, .md, .pptx, etc.).

Return only the JSON; no commentary.`;
